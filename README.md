# Deitel & Deitel - "C How To Program" - solutions to exercises

### Intro

[Here](https://github.com/lbraglia/chtp/tree/master/src) you can
find my solutions for **Deitel &amp; Deitel - "C How To Program"**.

The code is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
**without any warranty** (correctness, safety, etc).

Consider that exercises enumeration is based on italian
translation of the book (english 5th edition); likely (I hope) it
will be the same for others.

### How to contribute

If you wrote an exercise(s) solution(s) that I haven't done, feel
free to send it (them) to me. Please, contact me also if
you've found any bug in the sources on the web. 

* write your code (variable names, comments, strings etc) in
english;
* please, test your code before sending it: it must work as
expected by exercise question;
* don't, I repeat, don't copy and paste from copyrighted material
available online;
* every solution must be based only on chapter stuff or concepts
from previous chapters: not on stuff to be explained yet;
* *do* send me files like `xx_yy.c` (where `xx == chapter`, `yy ==
exercise_number`);
* tell me if you don't want to be mentioned in the contributors
list;
* I will not specify "who made what". If
you want the code paternity to be knowable, put a comment like
`/*Solution provided by foo*/` or something similar;
* The solutions will checked be with `gcc -Wall -Wextra -ansi -pedantic
xx_yy.c` and indented with GNU indent.
